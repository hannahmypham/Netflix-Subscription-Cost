## About the project
Netflix is one of my favorite streaming services. I have been curious about the how much other countries pay for monthly subscription plan and decided to create a personal project to analyze Netflix's subscription cost across countries.

This data set provides information about month subscription cost for 3 different plans: basic, standard and premium for 65 countries. 
The columns include: Country, Total library size, Number of movies, Number of TV shows, Monthly cost for basic plan, Monthly cost for standard plan, Monthly cost for premium plan 

## Questions for the analysis

5. Is there any additional findings that can be inferred from the analysis?
